Advanced Computer Architectures - Practical Assignment #2: Create a shell script that sends custom jobs (thread & core level parallelized code) to an SGE cluster scheduler in order to execute an HPC NPB Benchmark, so we can study the performance impact on a shared-memory multiprocessor when emulating different processor cache architectures (varying parameters such as parameters block size, cache size & associativity)
